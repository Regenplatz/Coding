### About the Project
A **recursive** algorithm was created to obtain the product of a list of natural odd numbers. Start and end values of the list's range are provided through input variables by the user. **Try** and **except** statements ensure the user's input of integer values. The order in which the highest and lowest values are given is irrelevant. If values greater than 20 are provided, an **exception is raised**.

### About the Code
