### About the Project
A binary search algorithm is used to find the position of a target value within a sorted list of values. This algorithm checks *recursively* if the target number is part of one of the halves of this sorted list: If the check result is negative, the corresponding half is eliminated and not further taken into consideration. The remaining half is then again divided into new halves. This process continues until the target value is found.


### About the Code
This code focuses on *recursion*. For more details, please refer to the code documentation within [binary_search.py](https://github.com/Regenplatz/Coding/Python/Recursion/BinarySearch/binary_search.py).
