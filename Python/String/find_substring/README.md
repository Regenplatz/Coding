### About the Project
The task was inspired by one that can be found [here](https://www.w3resource.com/python-exercises/string/): \
*Find the minimum window in a given string which contains all the characters of another given string.*


### About the Code
This code was written according to *PEP8 Style Guide* in April 2021.
It does not include object-oriented programming but focuses on both, the usage of various *functions* and *code documentation*.
